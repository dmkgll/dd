## about

I'm a writer, publisher, researcher, and archiver of internet things (or things that should be on the internet). This site is a miscellany of things that interest me, my writing, work, information about me, and useful things I wanted to see online. And other things. Click around. Eventually there will be an [about](/dd/about) page. You can email me at <code>makgill@protonmail.ch</code>.

[Here's a photo of me.](/)

I've worked for too many companies and projects to list, usually in "marketing." Industries include bitcoin, firearms and education. I've also worked as a researcher and ghostwriter. I used to speak often at conferences and universities about my experience dropping out of college, bitcoin and libertarianism. These days I work on my own things and am currently building some online stores and various small web projects.

I think the 1990's were the best time in human civilization and we are just starting to reverse the last two decades of stagnation and cultural rot.

I'm enjoy following internet rabbit trails. Old forums, wayback archives, deleted comments. I love that stuff. I'm interested in "conspiracy theories," bitcoin, online privacy, Ayn Rand, cryptoanarchy, Christianity, censorship, "lost" or "banned" literature, internet history & lore, indie web, the year 1993, old tech, and classic space Lego. I play competitive Age of Empires II, enjoy hiking and skiing, and read a lot more fiction than non-fiction.

## site info

HTML and JavaScript on this site is human readable in any browser and on any device and is made to last forever.

pages are designed to be saved and/or printed as PDF for offline use (although images usually must be downloaded separately). I prefer a dark reading background, so it's styled accordingly. Function over form. I enjoy reading scaling it to half my screen.
