## readme

this tutorial assumes a very basic understanding of html. you don't actually need to know html, you just need to be able to interpret it, ask google smart questions, rework it, and copy and paste. still, I recommend you invest
some time in learning it more thoroughly and understanding some of the more advanced things you can do on github pages that will make your life as webmaster easier.

## why you even should

---

## step one: create your github account and base site repository

create a github account and create a new repository. call this repository <code>username.github.io</code>. don't call it anything else. this will allow you to host a website at <code>http://username.github.io.</code> don't worry, you
can change the url later. subsquent repositories can be named whatever you like and can be found as part of your website at <code>http://username.github.io/whateveryouwanttoputhere</code>. for example, a repository
called <code>lloyd-christmas</code> would be hosted online at <code>http://username.github.io/lloyd-christmas</code>.

---

## step two: create your site homepage and style it

create a new file called <code>index.html.</code> this will be your homepage hosted at <code>http://username.github.io/</code>. copy following code to get a basic site going. 

```
<html>
<head>
<style>
body{font-family:sans-serif;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<main>
<h1>This is Mike Hammer's personal website.</h1>
<p>I'm a hard-nosed detective who likes to work outside the law. sometimes it gets me in trouble.</p>
</main>
</body>
</html>
```
